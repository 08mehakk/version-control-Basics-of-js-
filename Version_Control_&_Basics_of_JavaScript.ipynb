        "   Version Control Systems like Git are tools that help track changes in files, rollback and collaboration too.\n",
        "   1. Track changes:- Allows you to see what changes were made, who made them and when they were made.\n",
        "   2. Rollback:- If a mistake is made or something goes wrong, version control lets you reverse.\n",
        "   3. Collaboration:- Multiple people to work on the same project.\n",
        "   4. Backup:- Provides a backup of your project, ensuring that your work is safe in case of data loss or other issues.\n",

        "   1. Collaboration: Git enables multiple developers to work on the same project, reducing conflicts and errors.\n",
        "   2. Flexibility: Git's distributed architecture allows developers to work offline and sync changes later.\n",
        "   3. Scalability: Git can handle large projects with many contributors, making it suitable for complex software development.\n",
        "   4. Security: Git's version control ensures that changes are tracked, and previous versions can be recovered if needed.\n",
